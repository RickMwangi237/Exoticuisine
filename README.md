Simple Recipe website intended to show an understanding of fundamental HTML concepts and a grasp of basic git know how! 
I realize I went a little beyond what the project assignment needed me to do but i needed to prove to myself that i had a good understanding of 'The Odin Project' curriculum up until the point of this recipes assignment in the fundamentals section of the curriculum.
Strengths realised in this project: html boilerplate layout, creating absolute and relative links, lists.
Weaknesses realised in this project: git commit practice (I did not know when to commit and how to best structure the commit subject) Will work on this.
