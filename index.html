        <p>If you look closely enough, cultures around the world have more than a few things in common. However, you won't have to look too close, to realise one of these things is food! <strong>Everyone everywhere eats</strong>... Real shocker!! We here at Exoticuisine have made it our mission to broaden your cultural spectrum one plate <em>(or banana leaf as we'll find out some cultures prefer)</em> at a time.</p>
